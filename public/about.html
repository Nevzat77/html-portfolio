<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Nevzat Alpturk. I'm a 20-year-old Computer Science student at the University of Nicosia. 
  I speak both Turkish and English fluently, and I also have some basic knowledge of Greek.
</p> 

<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing football, chess, and video games. 
  I also started going to the gym when I was 17, and I've been training regularly for the past three years.
</p> 

<p>My career goal is to become a Web Developer â€” but who knows what the future holds!</p>
